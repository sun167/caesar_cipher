This is a small project using Ruby and I will put in use string, array and hash.

Caesar Cypher takes a string, for example: My name is Son, and a number, for example 1. The program should return the string with all the letters forwarded by one in the alphabet. 

Special symbols(?,!,.) will be untouched, as well as numbers.
